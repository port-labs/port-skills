# Getting started with Port

Every other skill in this repo produces correct Port config either way, but
without Port's MCP server connected, you're copying that config in by hand.
With it connected, the agent can read your live account and apply changes
directly. Do this once, first.

## Prerequisites

None. This is the first skill to run.

## How to get started

1. **Sign up for a Port account** at [app.port.io](https://app.port.io) if
   you don't have one yet.
2. **Connect Port's MCP server** to your coding agent:

   | Client | How to connect |
   |---|---|
   | Cursor | [Install in Cursor](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=port&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL21jcC5nZXRwb3J0LmlvL3YxIn0=) |
   | Claude (claude.ai / Claude Desktop) | [Install from the Claude directory](https://claude.ai/directory/8f5edd1c-c876-465e-a5b9-cc8e6d27dcb7) |
   | VS Code | [Install in VS Code](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=port&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22mcp-remote%22%2C%22https%3A%2F%2Fmcp.getport.io%2Fv1%22%5D%7D) |
   | Claude Code (CLI) | `claude mcp add --transport http port https://mcp.getport.io/v1` |
   | Any other MCP-compatible agent | Point it at `https://mcp.getport.io/v1`, or follow the [manual install docs](https://docs.port.io/ai-interfaces/port-mcp-server/installation) |

3. **Optional: install the [Port CLI](https://github.com/port-experimental/port-cli).**
   Beyond MCP, it covers day-to-day resource management from the terminal,
   and `port skills sync` pulls any skills your org has already configured
   in Port straight into your coding agent's skill directory.
4. **Once connected, prefer Port's own tools over guesswork.** Every skill
   in this repo notes where it can call Port's MCP tools directly (to read
   live state or apply a change) instead of just handing you config to
   copy in. If a skill doesn't cover something you need, search Port's
   documentation from inside the agent with the `search_port_knowledge_sources`
   MCP tool rather than guessing.

## Common pitfalls

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| MCP server added but no Port tools show up | Most agents need a session restart after adding an MCP server | Restart the coding agent |
| The Cursor/VS Code install link does nothing when clicked | Some browsers block custom URI schemes by default | Use the [manual install docs](https://docs.port.io/ai-interfaces/port-mcp-server/installation) instead |
| `claude mcp add` command not found | That command is Claude Code's own CLI, not Claude Desktop or claude.ai | Use the Claude directory link for Desktop/claude.ai instead |
